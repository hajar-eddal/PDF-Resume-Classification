classification models with bagging, boosting, and voting classifier. 

Handwritten Digit Recognition System 

Digit recognition system is the working of a machine to train itself or recognizing the digits from 
different sources like emails, bank cheque, papers, images, etc. and in different real- world scenarios 

for  online  handwriting  recognition  on  computer  tablets  or  system,  recognize  number  plates  of 
vehicles,  processing  bank  cheque  amounts,  numeric  entries  in  forms  filled  up  by  hand  (say — tax 
forms) and so on. 

Sales data forecasting 

In this project we have to train the ML model to learn for forecasting the data based on the previous 
data that model has learned. we have used sales data for training for certain period of time . we have 
developed LR model , ARIMA AND RNN model for this project. After training the model has to 
learn to predict the future sales 

Image classification 
In this project we have to train the ML model to learn to classify images based on the given unlabelled 
data. We have to separate the image for test and train set. In this model it has to learn to Classify on 
it’s own. We have use OPENCV2 , CNN and Tensorflow and Keras. After the model Development 
we train it using the train data set . We do the cross validation and calculate the accuracy score.

Projects  
Personalized Job Recommendation System (Team size - 4) (Capstone Project)  

Objective: To make the hiring process more convenient we built a recommendation system using the power of NLP and 
sentence transformers for the candidates/recruiters to suggest the candidates job recommendations based on their skill sets. 
IT Job Profiles scraped from Monster India and Candidate Profiles for different IT profiles scraped from Placement India for 
training. Dataset: 3500 job profiles and 10000+ candidate profiles  
Deployment: The project is being deployed on mUni Campus platform (https://municampus.com/)   

Facebook Comment Volume Prediction (Machine Learning)  

Objective: Building a Machine Learning model to predict the number of comments a Facebook post would receive based 
on several features such as likes, content category, page engagement rate, etc. Impact: This would help content creators in 
optimizing their pages and posts such that they can derive maximum engagement from their target audience.  Using a 
labelled dataset of 53 attributes of which 28 are base attributes and 25 are derived attributes.  

Effect of COVID19 on People's Health/Nutritional Habits and Preferences (Statistics)  

Objective: Through this study, we try to understand the effects of COVID-19 on the health / nutritional preferences (mainly 
sleep, diet and exercise) of people. Impact: We inferred that there was indeed an impact on these three factors. While the 
impact was positive on sleep and diet routines, the impact on exercise routines observed turned out to be slightly negative. 
Dataset: Collected 52 data points using a survey distributed through google form over a week’s period.

    KEY DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS  

Domain: Micro-Credit Defaulter Non-Defaulter classification   
Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook  
• 
• 

Objective: Build a predictive model for detecting defaulter and non-defaulter users.  
Solution: Did EDA, treated data imbalance using SMOTE, built multiple models & did hyper 
parameter tuning for best performing models in each category, treated outliers using percentile 
approach without removing the data.  
Domain :   Malignant Comment Classifier   
Tech   Stack:   Python,   Jupyter   Notebook   

• 

Key Achievements: Decision Tree on SMOTE oversampling as final model with AUC,0.94  
Objective : To build a classification model using NLP techniques to classify comments as 
good/neutral Or negative   
Solution: We have used NLP to pre-process and clean data.  Since we had 6 labels to be predicted we 
introduced a new column ‘label’ which shows ‘1’ for good/neutral comments and ‘0’ for negative 
comments  

•  We have used Vectorizer to convert comment tokens to numeric form.   
• 

After considering the mentioned algorithms we concluded Decision Tree Model to be best model 
which gave an accuracy of 95.2%.  

Domain: Rating Prediction Project  
Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook,   
• 
• 

Objective: Build a Classification model to predict the Ratings.  
Solution: performed data visualization using Matplotlib on different views, performed EDA, 
standard scaling to make data ready for multiple Classification models.  
Key Achievement: Successful results with Random Forest classifier model. And many more.
